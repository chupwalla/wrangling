    "# Wrangling Report:\n",
    "\n",
    "### I gathered three sets of data using different methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The enhanced archive from Udacity resources downloaded from the Resources link\n",
    "* Extended Tweet data by tweet ID from the Twitter API using Tweepy\n",
    "* The image-predictions TSV file from Udacity using the Requests library\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assessment Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quality\n",
    "* Some tweets in the archive are actually replies and/or retweets and duplicated data\n",
    "* Different column names for the same data (tweet_id vs. id, source)\n",
    "* df_tweet_info has id and str_id columns\n",
    "* id columns are not the same name in each table\n",
    "* The df source column is 90% the same value, and the other values are not informative or relevant (the df_tweet_info table has complete source values)\n",
    "* The df_tweet_info table has a number of columns with few or no entries(geo, coordinates, place, contributors)\n",
    "* Data types: retweet_count, favorite_count should be integers, not objects\n",
    "* Data types: truncated, favorited, retweeted, possibly_sensitive, possibly_sensitive_appealable are type object instead of boolean\n",
    "* The df_tweet_info display_text_range column is the wrong format (rename to display_text_length and convert current objects to single int values)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tidiness\n",
    "\n",
    "* The doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo columns are separate, and the column names are variables\n",
    "* The df_tweet_info entities and extended_entities columns cells contain multiple values\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "I combined the cleaned data into a single DataFrame and iterated over some cleaning steps to remove duplicate columns and correct data types, then exported the data to \"twitter_archive_master.csv\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analysis and Visualizing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using data from the combined DataFrame I plotted the number of each type of dog identified by the image-predictions AI to show the most to least prevalent breeds.\n",
    "* I also calculated the average tweet length for each type of dog(floofer, pupper, puppo, doggo).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ratings are all over the place, as it part of the appeal, but after January 2017 there are no ridiculously high ratings"
